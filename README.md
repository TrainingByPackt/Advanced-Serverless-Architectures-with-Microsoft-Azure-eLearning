# Advanced Serverless Architectures with Microsoft Azure [eLearning]
Advanced Serverless Architectures with Microsoft Azure shows you what to do when the requirements are no longer simple and straightforward. You'll learn how to deliver the required features quickly by building systems that retain the scalability and benefits of serverless. You'll also learn the best practices that help you to avoid the pitfalls that complex systems can quickly cause, and you'll be able to deliver resilient serverless systems. 

## What you will learn
* Understand what true serverless architecture is
* Study how to extend and scale architectures until they become ‘complex'
* Implement durable functions in your design
* Improve the observability of your serverless architecture
* Implement security solutions using serverless services
* Learn how to ‘practise' chaos engineering in production


### Hardware requirements
For an optimal learning experience, we recommend the following hardware configuration:
* Processor: i5 Quad Core or better
* Memory: 4GB RAM
* Storage: 10 GB available space

### Software requirements
You must also install in advance the following software:
*   Any desktop Linux version or macOS, or Windows 10.
